### Project 2 Title: State-Finance Housing


____

# **Overview**

- ### In this Project, our group will use financial information per each U.S. state from three different data tables. Using pandas, we will extract the tables from various sources, transform and clean it, and then load it into a PostgreSQL database. The end goal is to create a database fit for analysis.
